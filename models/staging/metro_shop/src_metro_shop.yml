#Build in the names of our columns or our tables (sources)
#loaded_at_field: timestamp you get from your loader tool (loaded at timestamp from our elt tool). _etl_loaded_at is the column which contains timestamp in orders and customers table
#warning will just tell you that your data is going stale. After 12 hours
#error will stop anything after the source freshness command from running. e.g if data is 24 hrs old you dont want to run any other commands
#testing also applied on sources. Gives us confidence on the raw data we are building on
